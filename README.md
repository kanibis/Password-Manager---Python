# Password-Manager---Python
In this online world, we log in many websites. And therefore, different passwords for most of the websites. But rarely remember any password of them. And sometimes, the websites won't let you sign up until you add a 'super-strong password.' But as a matter of sorrow, you forgot that password the next day.

There is a simple solution to this gigantic problem. Use a PASSWORD MANAGER.

Every password manager must save the password a user gives and output it when the user needs it. We are gonna apply the same thing to our password manager. 

At first, we are opening the file, and using 'a' argument, means we will append something in that file. Then we take input from the user about his user name, password and the website.
Now, we'll read what's in the text file we have created using read 'r' function.
